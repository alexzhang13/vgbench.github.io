            vision-language models to complete, in real-time, a suite of 20 different

            Language models (LMs) have shown to be capable of solving incredibly difficult reasoning tasks such as math 
            [<a href="#ref-17">17</a>,<a href="#ref-18">18</a>,<a href="#ref-19">19</a>] and coding [<a href="#ref-19">19</a>,<a href="#ref-20">20</a>,<a href="#ref-21">21</a>]. Many of these tasks are extraordinarily difficult for the average person, 
            primarily due to the large amount of prerequisite knowledge and pattern recognition abilities required. On the 
            other hand, while humans can complete video games, we have yet to see even the state-of-the-art LMs or VLMs 
            complete games such as Doom or Pokemon [<a href="#ref-14">14</a>]. This has led the community to focus on simple or hand-written games 
            [<a href="#ref-7">7</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>].
            Solving real video games requires long-term and short-term reasoning, spatial understanding, and intuition (e.g. 
            you need to find a key to open the locked door). In the past, AI models for games were trained specifically on 
            one game using an exponentially large exploration and/or expert trajectory budget [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>,<a href="#ref-2">2</a>,<a href="#ref-3">3</a>,<a href="#ref-4">4</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-22">22</a>]. VLMs are an 
            interesting alternative that can potentially solve multiple different types of games, even without explicitly 
            seeing them before. Thus, in the full <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench</span>, we also plan to provide a secret eval suite of games that 
            agents can evaluate on for performance.

        <h3 class="title is-2">VideoGameBench Framework and Environment</h3>
        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Our benchmark infrastructure provides a single environment in which an agent can 
            play the 20 games we selected, over both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy">Game Boy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> platforms.  
            At a high-level, our framework abstracts away the game emulator 
            (currently supporting Game Boy through <a href="https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy">PyBoy</a> and MS-DOS through <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBOX</a>) 
            and provides the agent with the input and output it needs:
          <ol>
            <li>Observations, in this case the game screen as an image</li>
            <li>An interface to communicate with the game "controller", through an action (e.g. press "<b>Space</b>"), a sequence of actions (e.g. press "<b>A</b>","<b>A</b>","<b>Start</b>"), or a sequence of timed actions (e.g. press "<b>Space</b>" for 5 seconds and then press "<b>A</b>").</li>
            <li>An indication of whether the game was successfully completed or not.</li>
          </ol>

          We stray away from including extra game information like parsed text or in-game 
          masks (as in DeepMind's StarCraft II AlphaStar [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>] and the PySC2 [<a href="#ref-23">23</a>] work) and focus on only providing the game screen to the model. 
          </p>

          <p>
          In this research preview, we provide a minimal implementation of our benchmark setup so you can quickly fork 
          and try your own agents on the benchmark! We are working on some other agent-specific features with our paper 
          release in the near future that are not currently included in our codebase. To help you build more complex agents, 
          we also provide a basic <span class="dnerf">VideoGameAgent</span> with memory and a corresponding UI 
          that works out-of-the-box with most common LLM API providers (e.g. GPT, Claude, Gemini, Deepseek, etc.) 
          through <a href="https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm">LiteLLM</a>. You can see the UI side-by-side with the game below:

        <br/>

        <p>
        Currently, we focus our benchmark on older Game Boy and classic MS-DOS video games
        because (1) they are noticeably simpler in visual cues than recent games and (2)
        they cover both controller and mouse + keyboard mechanics, which present different challenges to a VLM's spatial reasoning abilities than text-based / terminal game actions <span style="color: #4286f4">[6,24]</span>.

        <br>
        <p>
        <b>Benchmarking progress and game completion.</b> Finally, emulators and game engines 
        do not provide a special reward signal for game completion. 
        Therefore, we build a mechanism for detecting whether the agent has successfully 
        completed the game.  We do this by matching between reference "game completed" 
        screenshots and the agent's current screen -- this strategy is also useful 
        for user-defined "sub-goal completion" detection, which is useful for 
        benchmarking partial progress or campaign completion for certain games (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II:_Tides_of_Darkness">Warcraft II</a>, where we're only interested in completing the "Orc" campaign).

      We selected games based on relative difficulty and diversity of gameplay characteristics, 
      which we've roughly highlighted in the list below. Certain games involve completing 
      the entire single player mode (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Land">Super Mario Land</a>, 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link%27s_Awakening">Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>) 
      while others only involve completing a single campaign or game due to their lengths 
      (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">Civ 1</a>). 
      For certain games we also included sequels due to sufficient variety in world exploration.

       In our experience, current state-of-the-art VLMs substantially struggle to play video games because of high inference latency. 
       When an agent takes a screenshot(s) and queries the VLM about what action to take, 
       by the time the response comes back, the game state has changed significantly and the action is no longer relevant 
       (for example, an enemy shooting at the agent when the screenshot was taken might have now moved to standing in front of the agent).

    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        It becomes apparent after running an agent on any of these games that <b>VLM agents are not close to solving an entire game, 
        let alone even the first level of most games</b>. We have observed some interesting progress in games, e.g. 
        our agent getting to the first mini-boss of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land">Kirby's Dream Land</a> that is interesting to observe.

        This section is primarily focused on highlighting a few qualitative observations rather than rigorous quantitative experimentation. 
        All experiments use a basic <span class="dnerf">VideoGameAgent</span> that uses ReAct [<a href="#ref-25">25</a>] with memory 
        given a sequence of 5-10 frames and issues sequences of key-presses and mouse movements as actions.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b style="color: #8B0000">Organizing thoughts and goal oriented-ness.</b> There have been several prior works that successfully use LLMs for planning in games [<a href="#ref-13">13</a>] and some others that have attempted to solve text games [<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-15">15</a>,<a href="#ref-24">24</a>]. 
      In the multimodal setting, we found that agents often misinterpret events from the game screen -- this gap between visual event interpretation and the language understanding 
      causes unintended behavior, which can also affect the internal goals proposed by the agent. In the example below, the agent wastes its ammo thinking dead enemies are alive.

      </p>
      <p>
      <b style="color: #8B0000">The granularity of an "action".</b> An immediate issue when running a VLM on any real-time video game is the 3-5 second inference delay 
      between querying the VLM for an action given the current game screen and when the action is actually returned by the VLM. Inference latency
      of large models is unavoidable, so an interesting question is what granularity a VLM "action" takes -- is it a single key press, a sequence
      of key presses, code, or even a simple mini policy?

      <div style="text-align: center">
        <video id="teaser" autoplay muted loop playsinline height="100%" controls>

          on <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench</span>. The agent takes 3-5 seconds to respond to the current game screen, leading to it dying multiple times to the same Goomba.
      </div>

      </p>
      <p>
      <b style="color: #8B0000">Controller, Mouse + Keyboard Precision.</b> We found several instances of the agent / VLM struggling to translate the effect of actions (e.g. move right)
      on the screen. The most obvious across all frontier models we tried (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Gemini 2.5 Pro) was the inability to accurately move
      the position of the mouse for games like Civilization and Warcraft II, where frequent mouse movements are necessary.

          on <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench</span>. The agent struggles to move the mouse to the correct position, leading to it clicking "load game" instead of "new game" each.
      </div>

      </p>
      <p>
      <b style="color: #8B0000">Unintuitive Game Mechanics.</b> Unless explicitly prompted with proper instructions, many game mechanics are not obvious
      to VLMs. While seemingly obvious, this fact becomes more important when benchmarking on "secret" games, where game-specific
      prompts may be impossible and the model has to learn these mechanics from scratch.

    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <h3 class="title is-5">Reinforcement Learning (RL) on Games</h3>
      <p>
        The premise of this question is a bit mis-leading, since certain data-driven RL methods have already proven 
        to be able to fully solve games better than humans. For starters, RL has been able to solve Atari games [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] 
        for almost a decade now. In terms of superhuman game-playing AI, DeepMind's AlphaGo [<a href="#ref-22">22</a>] was a neural network 
        capable of defeating the human world champion, but it was arguable that the game's state and 
        action spaces are discrete. It was then believed that video games were infinitely more complicated, 
        but it turned out with DeepMind's AlphaStar [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>] and OpenAI Five [<a href="#ref-3">3</a>] that proper featurization of the 
        game environment made it roughly equivalent to the AlphaGo problem. Even in 3D game settings where this 
        featurization is significantly more difficult, there have been strong efforts such as the Dreamer papers [<a href="#ref-4">4</a>] 
        that are actively building agents on games like Minecraft.

        Recently, a larger question with RL on video games is whether language-heavy games can be solved. 
        These methods rely on using language models to replace / model some module of the reinforcement learning pipeline, 
        e.g. the value function. One particularly interesting modern example are new agents on the popular 
        turn-based battle simulator <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/" target="_blank">Pokemon Showdown</a>, which have now achieved human-competitive performance using a mix of language models and RL-style policies [<a href="#ref-5">5</a>].
        Another prominent example is the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/cicero/diplomacy/" target="_blank">CICERO</a> agent [<a href="#ref-26">26</a>] for the multi-player strategy game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy_(game)" target="_blank">Diplomacy</a>.

      </p>

      <h3 class="title is-5">Pure VLMs and LMs playing Video Games.</h3>
      <p>
      There exists a class of unsolved video games that are extremely difficult for both RL methods and VLMs to solve. 
      These games tend to involve some form of language component, long-form exploration / objectives, and 
      spatial reasoning puzzles – the <a href="https://balrogai.com/">BALROG</a> benchmark contains a suite of these games for VLMs to 
      solve with progress indicators [<a href="#ref-6">6</a>]. One of the most popular case studies of AI for games 
      has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">NetHack</a> [<a href="#ref-6">6</a>,<a href="#ref-8">8</a>,<a href="#ref-9">9</a>] which is a grid world terminal game with an extraordinarily 
      complex combat, item, and dungeoning system (+ randomization) that makes it difficult for humans to complete. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench</span> deviates slightly from these benchmarks in that a possible solution to most of the games 
      is to learn a policy through "sufficiently large" RL-style exploration 
      (e.g. Pokemon Red has been solved multiple times using RL [<a href="#ref-10">10</a>,<a href="#ref-11">11</a>], shooters like Doom have RL training platforms [<a href="#ref-16">16</a>]). 
      Unlike RL algorithms, while certain information about video games are most likely present in the training data of VLMs, 
      it is significantly smaller than what is provided to RL methods. There have been some preliminary works in this area that try to in-context learn a policy from a VLM
      for even simpler games as well [<a href="#ref-27">27</a>].

      Recently, there has been a lot more interest in evaluating the capabilities of newer frontier models and 
      agent approaches for solving the aforementioned games such as 
      <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon" target="_blank">Claude plays Pokemon</a> and now <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon" target="_blank">Gemini plays Pokemon</a> (which uses a more interesting agentic approach).
      Another recent major effort has been by the <a href="https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">Hao AI lab</a> to build a <a href="https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent" target="_blank">platform</a> for
      VLM agents to play games like Mario, Sokoban, and Candy Crush in real-time (their work is awesome so please check them out!) [<a href="#ref-12">12</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench</span> and <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench-Lite</span> similarly focus on real video games, 
        but use a fixed and diverse set of challenging games (e.g. platformers, shooters, RTS, RPGs, 2D, 2.5D, 3D, etc.) 
        with a standard common interface. The common environment is also designed to eventually enable plugging in various emulators without any extra friction. 
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="title is-2">Extending to New Games</h3>
    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        It is easy to run other Game Boy or MS-DOS games on our platform by downloading the ROM / js-dos link and adding a new config with specifications (e.g. defining a game-specific prompt, a preset list of actions to run when a game loads like pre-selecting the difficulty, and game settings). We provide explicit instructions in our GitHub README.

        Extending to other emulators is also relatively simple, but we currently do not support this in a no-code fashion. We want to add diverse support to maintain our benchmark, so we welcome open-source contributions – we generally would like to work in the open!

        Finally, we picked a specific set of games for our benchmark, but we encourage people to run and experiment with other games on our environment.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to emphasize that the development of <span class="dnerf">VideoGameBench</span> was made possible by leveraging existing open-source emulators. We are grateful to the developers of <a href="https://github.com/Baekalfen/PyBoy" target="_blank">PyBoy</a>, <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank">DOSBox</a>, <a href="https://js-dos.com/overview.html" target="_blank">JS-DOS</a>, and <a href="https://playwright.dev/" target="_blank">Playwright</a>. This benchmark uses proprietary games, please make sure to purchase these games before running the benchmark.

    <h3 class="title is-2">Last Thoughts</h3>
    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      <p>
        Benchmarking frontier models and agents on real video games is both flashy and experimentally useful for measuring reasoning capabilities. Unlike extremely complicated domains like unsolved math proofs and olympiad-level math problems, playing video games is not a superhuman reasoning task, yet models still struggle to solve them. Furthermore, while most progress has been on LLM and text-only reasoning, few benchmarks evaluate reasoning capabilities over multimodal domains in an interpretable and widely understandable setting.
